# Skunk Programming Language

**Skunk** is a statically typed, interpreted programming language designed for simplicity, learning, and extensibility. It provides a clean syntax for working with structured data, control flow, and functions while supporting extensible features like user-defined types and type inference.

## Features

- **Basic Types**: `int`, `string`, `boolean`
- **User-Defined Structs**: Define custom types with fields and methods
- **Control Flow**: `if`, `for` loops, and blocks for scoped variable overrides
- **Arrays**: Support for array initialization, slicing (upcoming), and dynamic resizing
- **Functions**: First-class functions with support for closures and higher-order programming (upcoming)
- **Type Checking**: Ensures type correctness at parse-time with detailed error messages
- **Type Inference**: Planned for a cleaner developer experience
- **String Interpolation and Concatenation**: Upcoming for intuitive string operations
- **Generics**: Upcoming for flexible and reusable data structures

## Example Programs

### Hello, World
```skunk
function main(): void {
    print("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Variables and Control Flow
```skunk
function main(): void {
    x: int = 10;
    if (x > 5) {
        print("x is greater than 5");
    } else {
        print("x is not greater than 5");
    }
}
```

### Structs and Methods
```skunk
struct Point {
    x: int;
    y: int;

    function set_x(self, x: int): void {
        self.x = x;
    }

    function get_x(self): int {
        return self.x;
    }
}

function main(): void {
    p: Point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
    p.set_x(10);
    print(p.get_x());
}
```

### Arrays
```skunk
function main(): void {
    arr: int[3] = [1, 2, 3];
    for (i: int = 0; i < arr.len; i = i + 1) {
        print(arr[i]);
    }
}
```

### Function Calls
```skunk
function add(a: int, b: int): int {
    return a + b;
}

function main(): void {
    result: int = add(5, 7);
    print(result);
}
```

### Nested Blocks
```skunk
function main(): void {
    x: int = 1;
    {
        x: int = 2;
        print(x); // Prints 2
    }
    print(x); // Prints 1
}
```

### Lambdas, Anonymous Functions, and Closures in Skunk

Skunk supports **lambdas**, **anonymous functions**, and **closures**, providing flexible and powerful tools for functional-style programming. These features allow you to define and manipulate functions dynamically, capturing variables from their enclosing scope.

---

#### **Lambdas and Anonymous Functions**

Lambdas in Skunk are inline, unnamed functions that can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. They are defined using the `function` keyword.

#### Syntax:

```skunk
function(parameters): return_type {
    // function body
}
```

#### Example:

##### Simple Lambda:

```skunk
greet: (string) -> void = function(name: string): void {
    print("Hello, " + name);
}
greet("Alice");
```

##### Lambda as Argument:

```skunk
function execute(task: () -> void): void {
    task();
}

execute(function(): void {
    print("Task executed!");
});
```

---

#### **Closures**

Closures are functions that capture variables from their enclosing scope. This allows closures to "remember" the environment in which they were created.

#### Syntax:

Closures are defined like regular functions but can access variables from the scope in which they were created.

#### Example:

##### Counter Example:

```skunk
function createCounter(): () -> int {
    counter: int = 0;
    return function(): int {
        counter = counter + 1;
        return counter;
    }
}

increment: () -> int = createCounter();
print(increment()); // Output: 1
print(increment()); // Output: 2
```

#### Nested Closures:

Closures can also nest, allowing inner closures to capture variables from their parent closures.

##### Example:

```skunk
i: int = 0;

a: () -> () -> int = function(): () -> int {
    i = i + 1;
    j: int = 0;

    b: () -> () -> int = function(): () -> int {
        i = i + 1;
        j = j + 1;
        k: int = 0;

        c: () -> int = function(): int {
            i = i + 1;
            j = j + 1;
            k = k + 1;
            return i + j + k;
        }

        return c;
    }

    return b();
}

f: () -> int = a();
res: int = f();
print(res); // Output: 6 (3 + 2 + 1)
```

---

#### **Use Cases**

1. **Encapsulation**: Closures allow you to encapsulate state and behavior.
2. **Callbacks**: Lambdas can be used as callbacks for asynchronous operations.
3. **Functional Programming**: Enable higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
4. **Recursion**: Support recursive functions with captured variables.

---

#### **Tips and Best Practices**

1. **Avoid Over-Capturing:** Be mindful of what variables a closure captures to avoid unintended dependencies.
2. **Mutability:** Remember that captured variables are shared, and modifying them in one closure affects others.
3. **Keep Closures Simple:** For readability and maintainability, try to keep closures concise.

---

Closures and lambdas are integral features of Skunk, empowering you to write expressive and modular code. By understanding how they work, you can leverage their full potential in your programs.




### Error Handling with Type Checker
```skunk
function main(): void {
    i: int = "wrong"; // Type error: Cannot assign string to int
}
```
